Basic Unity Game Pong with gitignore.

Navigate to https://github.com/clivemiller/pong

If you only want to run the executable, click the download button in the _BUILD directory at https://github.com/clivemiller/pong/tree/main/_BUILD,
and run the pong exe in the _BUILD directory to play the game directly.

To build the project yourself or run it in Unity, download the full repository by running the following command in your command terminal in your target directory:
git clone https://github.com/clivemiller/pong.git

This will copy the repository onto your disk and let you view, edit, and run the code.

In order to begin working with the unity game, you will first need to open it in unity.

First, install Unity Hub and Unity 6000.3.4f1. Complete the installation and setup.

Open the Unity Hub and click the Add button in the projects tab.
Then in the dropdown menu, click Add project from disk and select the cloned repository.

Double click the imported project to open it in Unity.

Once in, click scenes, then "SampleScene" to open the pong game in the window. 
You can then run it in the window or build it from the file tab
